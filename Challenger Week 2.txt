1st Question 

3412. Find Mirror Score of a String
Problem Statement: You are given a string s.
We define the mirror of a letter in the English alphabet as its corresponding letter when the
alphabet is reversed. For example, the mirror of &#39;a&#39; is &#39;z&#39;, and the mirror of &#39;y&#39; is &#39;b&#39;.
Initially, all characters in the string s are unmarked.
You start with a score of 0, and you perform the following process on the string s:
Iterate through the string from left to right.
At each index i, find the closest unmarked index j such that j &lt; i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i].
Then, mark both indices i and j, and add the value i - j to the total score.
If no such index j exists for the index i, move on to the next index without making any changes.
Return the total score at the end of the process.

Example 1:
Input: s = &quot;aczzx&quot;
Output: 5
Explanation:
i = 0. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip.
i = 1. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip.
i = 2. The closest index j that satisfies the conditions is j = 0, so we mark both indices 0 and 2,
and then add 2 - 0 = 2 to the score.
i = 3. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip.
i = 4. The closest index j that satisfies the conditions is j = 1, so we mark both indices 1 and 4,
and then add 4 - 1 = 3 to the score.
Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;abcdef&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation:
For each index i, there is no index j that satisfies the conditions.

2nd Question 

1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted
Problem Statement : Given an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty)
from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.
Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The
remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].
Example 2:
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element.
Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].
Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any
elements.

Constraints:
1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 10^5
0 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 10^9
